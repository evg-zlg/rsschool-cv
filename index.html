    <h2>Brief information about me</h2>
    <p>
      My goal is to learn how to use Frontend development tools to create useful things. <br>
      At the same time, it is important that no one gets hurt :)
    </p>
    <p>
      My entire work experience (more than 10 years) is related to sales and project management in the field of engineering systems (IT infrastructure, security systems, climate, electrical). <br>
      I have an incomplete higher education related to development and business reengineering, in which I studied Delphi, MSSQL, algorithms, mathematics, economics, business process modeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time ago, I was drawn back to development. <br>
      I tried various directions, settled on Frontend, because you can immediately see the result, the toolkit is easily configured, and the endless potential for developing any applications.

    <h2> Code example </h2>
    <h3> Convert string to camel case (kata from codewars). </h3>
    <p>
      Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).
    </p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <p>
      <code>"the-stealth-warrior"</code> gets converted to <code>"theStealthWarrior"</code>
      <br>
      <code>"The_Stealth_Warrior"</code> gets converted to <code>"TheStealthWarrior"</code>

          I needed a timer for circuit training, I made it and still use it. Used React to see what it is.
